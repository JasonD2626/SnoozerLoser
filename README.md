# SnoozerLoser

We've all had to deal with the issue of waking up early, primarily because of how easy it is to simply just click that snooze button on our alarms. I designed this application over the course of a few weeks to combat exactly that. It plays an annoyingly loud sound to wake you up at a designated time, which can only be disabled by typing an assortment of random letters.
